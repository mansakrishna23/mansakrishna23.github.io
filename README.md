# Mansa's Blog 
### (Used to be UCLA - PIC16B Demonstration Website)

This repository initially hosted a demonstration website for use of students in PIC16B, a course in computational science with Python taught at UCLA. It is lightly modified from Barry Clark's excellent [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/). 

Since then, I have updated the blog post on my own with more blog posts!

Mansa's site is published [here](https://mansakrishna23.github.io/)
