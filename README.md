# PIC16B Demonstration Website

This repository hosts a demonstration website for use of students in PIC16B, a course in computational science with Python taught at UCLA. It is lightly modified from Barry Clark's excellent [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/). 

Mansa's site is published at: https://mansakrishna23.github.io/
